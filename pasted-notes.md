* the "incentivize"  problem the video just mentioned is where i've been buried for the last couple of weeks  
  * e.g. reward agents for completing byte sequences  
  * influences routing and IPC design   
* stack height has to do with the layering stuff we were talking about too  
  * good layer design shortens stack height, e.g. pg layers at the moment look something like:  
    * 1-4: internet  
    * 5: byte sequence routing (double auction incentives, promise-based currencies)  
    * 6: byte sequence completion (pg kernel abstracts this from routing)  
    * 7: apps that call compute and storage services using byte completion  
* decentralized AI is a subset of decentralized computing  
  * pg is decentralized computing, will support decentralized AI including lower-layer services e.g. auction and completion

* ah, she's gonna talk about computing on encrypted data  
* i was just last week looking at using that related to promise matching   
* and zero-knowledge proofs \-- that too.  This is freaky, making me feel less crazy anyway

  * Steve grok this paper  
  * One-shot Private Aggregation with Single Client Int…  
  * Our work aims to minimize interaction in secure computation due to the high cost and challenges associated with communication rounds, particularly in scenarios with many clients. In this work, we revisit the problem of secure aggregation in the single-server setting where a single evaluation server can securely aggregate client-held individual i...  
* the byte-completion model we've been talking about is one-shot \-- one round trip, not chatty  
* Q\&A  
* occurs to me that, if we do it right, promisegrid would work as a general-purpose platform providing infrastructure for the sort of research these folks are doing, save them some infrastructure work  
* funny that story she just told about needing to convince folks at JPMC to try something new \-- yep, been there 😜  
* i'll need to look at her MPC auction model, how she's doing order matching \-- that's actually something I was thinking through last week  
* layer 5: we need the order matching to find exchange rates for the personal currencies that are the promise make/break reputation   
  * i.e. agents need to be able to do currency trading to find those rates via price discovery   
  * personal currencies are issued by each agent (each is own central bank)  
  * value of any currency is based on what it can buy  
  * agent requires payment in its own currency for computation services rendered  
    * this gives the currency its value  
  * an agent that behaves well (keeps promises) will experience more demand for its services  
    * an agent that behaves well will experience increased currency value  
  * an agent that behaves badly (breaks promises) will experience less demand for its services  
    * an agent that behaves badly will experience reduced currency value  
  * therefore, we need to be able to discover the value of an agent's currency  
  * we discover value by looking at the exchange rates that others are willing to buy/sell the currency for, relative to other currencies  
  * an agent can use the same exchange rate mechanisms to translate all currency values into values that are relative to the agent's own currency  
  * we can then use relative currency values to determine routing priorities etc.  
* she's talking about the problem of getting counterparties to run her protocols when those counterparties are large institutions \-- it's not going to work that way, and that's what she's finding.  this sort of thing usually comes up from the small shops first.

* [https://www.coophive.network/](https://www.coophive.network/)  
* coophive uses an escrow model  
  * escrow tends to cause higher friction  
* coophive hardcodes mediation and other protocols, vs promisegrid which does not in pg, even the double-auction and promise currency stuff is pluggable because the basic primitive is byte completion   
* coophive is similar to pretty much like everything else folks are working on for infrastructure layers \-- large set of complex primitives  
* many assumptions, hard to evolve  
  * not future-proof  
* he's right that market-making is something that should emerge organically \-- any agent should be able to post bid/ask quotes to make markets, incentives should be aligned to encourage that  
* Introducing white hat agents to find holes where individuals/groups can collude is interesting  
  * any agent's goal is to maximize utility \- even by means of breaking rules / cheating  
  * deploy AI-ish white hats to find hackable loopholes  
    * Steve thinking that GA agents might be best at this  
  * use lessons learned from the white hats to close those holes via regs/code  
* his "three primitives":   exchange assets, make commitments, negotiation  
  * commitments are promises and are the fundamental primitive here \-- he's mixing layers  
  * this might be feeding into why coophive has a lot of hardcoded assumptions in order to make things work  
  * not finding true primitives early enough tends to lead to complex designs that evolve to fill the edge cases that exist because the primitives you're using weren't the real primitives
