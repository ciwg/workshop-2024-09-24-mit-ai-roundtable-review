# Fully Homomorphic Computation (FHE)

**Presenter:** Rand Hindi

- **Definition:** A form of encryption allowing computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.
- **Applications:** Enables secure data processing in decentralized AI without compromising privacy.
- **Benefits:** Preserves data confidentiality, supports complex computations on sensitive information.

---

# Comparison of FHE vs Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

**Key Points:**

- **FHE:**
  - Allows arbitrary computations on encrypted data.
  - Single-party focus; computations done on ciphertexts by a single entity.
  - Higher computational overhead compared to MPC.

- **MPC:**
  - Involves multiple parties jointly computing a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
  - Suitable for scenarios requiring collaboration without trust.
  - Generally more efficient for specific types of computations compared to FHE.
