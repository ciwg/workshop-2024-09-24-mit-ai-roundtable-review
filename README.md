# What is Decentralized AI?

Decentralized AI refers to the distribution of AI computations and data across multiple autonomous agents or nodes, enhancing scalability, privacy, and resilience. Unlike centralized systems, decentralized AI empowers individual participants and leverages collective intelligence.

# Secret Sharing Using Polynomial Curves

Secret sharing is a method to distribute a secret among multiple parties, ensuring that only a subset can reconstruct it. Polynomial curves, specifically Shamir's Secret Sharing, use polynomial interpolation to achieve this. Each participant holds a share of the polynomial, and together they can reconstruct the secret, enhancing data security and privacy in decentralized AI systems.

# Double Auction Markets for Computational Services

Double auction markets facilitate the exchange of computational resources between buyers and sellers. In decentralized AI, this mechanism allows participants to offer computational power or AI services in exchange for compensation. By enabling competitive bidding and dynamic pricing, double auction markets optimize resource allocation and incentivize efficient participation in the AI ecosystem.

# Multiparty Computation (MPC)

Multiparty Computation allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In decentralized AI, MPC enables collaborative model training and data analysis without exposing sensitive information. This enhances privacy and trust among participants, fostering secure and cooperative AI development.

---

# Fully Homomorphic Computation (FHE)

Fully Homomorphic Computation allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without the need for decryption. In decentralized AI systems, FHE enables secure data processing and analysis while preserving data privacy. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential even during computation, enhancing trust and security in collaborative AI endeavors.

# FHE vs MPC

| Feature                | Fully Homomorphic Computation (FHE) | Multi-Party Computation (MPC)      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Privacy Model**      | Computes on encrypted data          | Computes on plaintext data with distributed inputs |
| **Communication Needs**| Minimal communication between parties | Higher communication overhead due to data sharing |
| **Computational Efficiency** | Generally more computationally intensive | Typically more efficient for certain computations |
| **Use Cases**          | Secure data processing, privacy-preserving AI model training | Collaborative model training, secure data analysis without revealing individual inputs |
| **Security Assumptions** | Relies on strong encryption schemes | Relies on protocol security and honest/malicious participant models |

# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)

Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. In decentralized AI systems, ZKPs can verify computations and data integrity without exposing underlying data, ensuring both security and privacy. This technology is crucial for maintaining trust and compliance in decentralized environments.
